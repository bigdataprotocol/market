. **Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Intellectual Property Infringements** 



1. Respect of Third Party Rights. We comply with the provisions of the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. §512, as amended). If 
you have an intellectual property rights-related complaint about material appearing on the
Site, then you may contact us at the following email address: info@bigdataprotocol.com 

Any notice alleging that materials hosted by or distributed through the Site infringe
intellectual property rights (“Notification of Claimed Infringement”) must include the
following information:
1.  an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the
3. a description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on the Site; 
3. your address, telephone number and email address; 
3. a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the materials on the Site of which you are complaining is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and

2.  Repeat Infringer Policy. BDP’s intellectual property policy is to: (i) remove or disable access to material that BDP believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Site; (ii) remove any User Content Submitted by Users who are determined to be “repeat infringers”; and (iii) promptly terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers. BDP currently considers a “repeat infringer” to be any User that has Submitted User Content and for whom BDP has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User Content. BDP has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single Notification of Claimed Infringement (as defined in Section 5.a) or upon BDP’s own determination. 

**6. Restrictions on Use of the Site**

13. assist or permit any person in engaging in any of the activities described above.

8. **Feedback** 

If you choose to provide us with input or suggestions regarding problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the Site or Services (“Feedback”), then you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), worldwide and royalty-free right to use and exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose without any restriction, credit, attribution or fees due to you. 

9. **Dispute Resolution** 



1. General. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and BDP in the most expedient 
and cost-effective manner, you and BDP agree that any dispute arising out of or in any 
way related to this Agreement or your use of the Site or Services will be resolved by 
binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a 
neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in 
court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same
damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes 
all claims arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or your use of the Site or 
Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other 
legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after any subsequent 
updates to or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND BDP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR
TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. 
2. Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 9.a above, nothing in this Agreement will be 
deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an 
individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the 
applicable federal, state or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive 
relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) to file suit in a 
court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. 
3. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and BDP will be governed by the Federal 
Arbitration Act and be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in 
accordance with the JAMS rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible 
at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/) and you and BDP hereby 
expressly waive trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-
wide arbitration. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to 
the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement and 
the Agreement. 
4. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice 
of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail (“Notice”). BDP’s address for Notice is by 
email at info@bigdataprotocol.com. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of 
the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties 
agree to make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not 
reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or BDP 
may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any 
settlement offer made by you or BDP must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved 
through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written 
settlement amount offered by BDP prior to selection of an arbitrator, then BDP will pay 
you the highest of the following: (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (2) the 
last written settlement amount offered by BDP in settlement of the dispute prior to the 
arbitrator’s award; or (3) $15,000. 
5. Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, then BDP will 
reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than 
$15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by 
the JAMS Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon 
in New York, New York, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you may choose 
whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted 
to the arbitrator; or (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing. If the 
arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand 
is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by 
the JAMS Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse BDP for all monies previously 
disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. 
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a
reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on 
which the decision and award, if any, are based. Each party agrees that such written 
decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except 
to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The 
arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of 
fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party 
made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. Notwithstanding anything in 
this Agreement to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award 
injunctive relief as a remedy in any arbitration required under these dispute resolution 
provisions. 
6. |No Class Actions. **YOU AND BDP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS** 
**AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY** 
**AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED** 
**CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and** 
**BDP agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s** 
**claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class** 
**proceeding.** 
7. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in this 
Agreement, if BDP makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a 
change to BDP’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending us 
written notice within 30 days of the change to BDP’s address for Notice, in which case 
this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will 
continue to govern any disputes between you and BDP. 
8. Enforceability. If Section 9.f above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this 
Section 9 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 9 will be null and 
void. 
10. **Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties** 

THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 10 APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:

In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting BDP’s defense of such matter at your sole expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver by any User of any of his, her or its legal rights under applicable U.S. federal laws or any other laws whose applicability is not permitted to be contractually waived. 

13. **Term and Termination of the Agreement**
